				You know I am a big a Samuel L Jackson fan. He is one of my favorite actors of all times, his roles are as diverse as he is. I really
				became a fan after seeing this interview with him and one of those actor talk shows where the host asks the actor or actress a bunch of
				well thought out  questions that deep into the life of the actor and tries to open them up to the audience.I am using the slipum
				generator that produces high quality text that is true the Samuel Jackson dialog in his movies, so hold on to your butts, here comes some
				shit!
				<p>
				Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they
				haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of
				dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit
				bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul. <a class="read" href="#">Read On..</a>

						Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
						called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make
						shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
						going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
						television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of
						the ones that became nothing.
